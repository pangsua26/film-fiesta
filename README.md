# Film Fiesta

## Description 

Film Fiesta is an application that lets users securely log in and save movies to a list for future reference. As we are preoccupied with everyday things, life can sometimes be a bit too hectic.

Simply add a movie or tv show to your watch list and input a synopsis if you would like and delete when you are finished!
